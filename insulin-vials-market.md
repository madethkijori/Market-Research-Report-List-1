<p><strong>The Insulin Vials Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Type 1 Diabetes</li><li>Type 2 Diabetes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The insulin vials market serves critical applications primarily for managing Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes requires lifelong insulin therapy as the pancreas produces little to no insulin. In contrast, Type 2 diabetes often involves insulin therapy when oral medications are insufficient due to insulin resistance or progressive pancreatic decline. Both patient populations rely on insulin vials to regulate blood glucose levels, prevent complications, and maintain quality of life, driving demand in the global healthcare market.</p></p>
